Boss Life Steal is a simple mod that gives bosses the ability to lifesteal from players. 
The amount of life it will heal is damage * multiplier.
The default for he multipiler is 3, but you can tweak it in the config, as well as if boss minions should be able to also life steal, and if it should say the amount of life stolen in chat.

The original idea for this mod was from Typhee420. I just coded the mod.
If you are a Terraria Content Creator that is going to use this mod, please give me proper credit by mention that I was the one who made it, and that you link my channel (https://www.youtube.com/@first_fractal), mod, or website (https://firstfractal.com) in the description.
